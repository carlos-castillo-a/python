# Notes

## Conditionals
- There are six *comparators* in Python that are relevant to an if/then statement
	- `<` : less than
	- `<=` : less than or equal to
	- `==` : equal
	- `>=` greater than or equal to
	- `>` greater than
	- `!=` : not equal to

[Weather](weather.py)
```bash
$ python3 weather.py 
It's too hot! > 80: 
```

### Rock ,Paper, Scissors
- Using `if/else` statements allow you to create a check to see if something is true or not and create custom outputs depending on results
- The [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) contains built in functions that can me imported, in this case the [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) function

[Rock, Paper, Scissors](rock-paper-scissors.py)
```bash
$ python3 rock-paper-scissors.py
rock, paper, or scissors? rock
